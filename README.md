This was my final project for my intro course to Computer Engineering at UTRGV. I combined every aspect of what we learned in this first semster and applied it to this proect to create a simple and effective air quality monitoring device that uses the MQ-2 sensor to detect harmful gases.
Pollutants include: Methane (CH₄), propane, hydrogen (H₂), carbon monoxide (CO), smoke, and other flammable or hazardous gases. I also incorporated a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, which play a large role in air quality and the accuracy of gas detection as well.

In this repository I have the slides I created for the project and the code used to operate the system through Arduino.
